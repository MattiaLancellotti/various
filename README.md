## Introduction
This is basically a trashcan or something like that. Here I throw everything
that doesn't deserve its own repository. Some things are cool like *boh* and
some others are just exercises from the short amount of time I passed in
university or just because I wanted to try some languages or some techniques.  
Some of them might be even useful to you, dear reader.

## What's actually in here?
You will find some linux kernel modules, little programs in Lua, random stuff in
using the pthreads library, maybe some more Golang stuff, random lisp programs
and a lot of random things I do.
